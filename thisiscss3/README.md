#This is CSS3

This is the second of three exercises, which build off of each other. You'll get comfortable with using CSS selectors and rules to dictate display, while keeping your styles separate from your content.

###Prerequisites
* You've completed [This is HTML5](https://github.com/chrisbay/thisisthemodernweb/tree/gh-pages/thisishtml5)
* Familiarity with the basics of CSS: where styles can go, basic syntax, and a few rules
* Read the article [Specifics on CSS Specificity](https://css-tricks.com/specifics-on-css-specificity/) as well as the Mozilla Developer's Network [article on Specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity)
* You know how to use your browser's developer tools

###Your mission, should you choose to accept it:

1. Working in the same file as the previous exercise, style your document. Create a file names `styles.css` and start adding styles there, being sure to link the stylesheet to your main document.
2. Add in a normalization stylesheet (see the Resources section below for links), tweaking it to suit your taste.
2. Employ the box model: Use margin and padding to space your elements properly.
3. Veritically center the text in an element that contains a single line of text, and is block-level. (Hint: Google this, and you'll find the answer relies on using `height` in conjunction with `line-height`).
4. Use at least one of each of the following types of selectors: element, class, id, pseudo-class. Also utlize compound selectors
5. Use at least one CSS transition.
6. Float at least one element.
7. Pull in a font using `@font-face` to use for a heading, or other special element. Create a browser-supported font-stack for the rest of your page.
8. Don't break these rules:
	* Use document-level and inline styles sparingly, and only when absolutely necessary
	* At all costs, avoid adding HTML elements in order to achieve a specific visual effect, unless it also adds sementic meaning to your document
	* Use font units smartly (i.e. avoid absolute sizes)
9. As before, be creative! Make your page look great, and don't settle for checking off the items above. Have a look at [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com) for inspiration.
10. Commit your code to your fork, push, and submit a pull request to the main repo. You'll get some feedback via issues filed on your project, which is likely to be both creative suggestions as well as fixes.
