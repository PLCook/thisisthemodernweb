		<h2>CISC6</h2>

			<section id="invitation">
				<p>	
					I can recall preparation for and participation in the Millennial Inter-dimensional Strongthing Competition of 6. I received an invitation through dmail, sent by the Sult of Managmus, current holder of the Ink, an enemy of my cousin Pir. The Sult is not to be denied, no matter how much hate is harbored for it. Note, my third rebirth occurred just two years prior. My new body wasn't totally on board with its imminent increase in mass. But after an ass-kicking, it had no choice.

					A large chunk of my time was spent trying to attain the B.U.L.K., a set of qualities required for entry into the contest. My weight was 4 grams. Most of the competition weighed at least 52 tons. Fortunately, Pir has connections to a major supplier of mass in the Lower Mesh and hooked me up with some. The mass subjected me to the worst hells ever created. But it was worth it; by the end of training, I'd gained a ton of weight. I now qualified for CISC.

					The competition, held in the 5th Tachyon Zone, had competitors with huge, bronze things with slick, oily, bulky boulder bodies. And while my frame was much smaller, I had the Glow. With the Glow and the Mass, my chances of winning increased. Or, at least my confidence did. I arm-wrestled, whale-hugged, brawled, and mountain-tossed my way to the finals. My third forearm snapped while arm-wrestling, so I had to use just two arms for the remainder of the contest. But victory was close, and there was no time for quitting now. Besides, I had to repay the LM supplier for all the mass. And now I would have to face the Sult.

					The Sult manipulates multiple vessels with a single conscious, weighs half a ton, and has eight arms. I was out-armed, but determined. The final event would have us wrestle for two lifetimes. No tapping out. There was no indication that the match had started. I found myself being suplexed for 700 years. I was later denied resurrection.
