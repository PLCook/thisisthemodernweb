			<h2>an evening like any other... </h2>
		</header>
		<p>
		It was an unseasonably warm evening for late July in the Midwest.  The air, thick and unmoving, hung motionless in the air.  Having received some much needed rain via an afternoon deluge, the dark skies relinquished to a clear and bright night.  The pale light of the moon danced among the humid plumes of air creeping slowly across the surface of the lake, creating an effect not dissimilar to smoke moving across a mirror.  The still embrace of this summer night was set in stark contrast to the open, even inviting, skybox above.  Vast, open, and without a cloud to mar the expanse of freckled space that promised relief from the choking blanket below.  This effect was doubled by the crystalline surface of Bastion Lake, reflecting back the vibrant light that had travelled lifetimes to reach this tiny patch of land in Missouri; only to be trapped by the same uncompromising stillness that stifled all who remained awake as the moon made her slow ascent.

		Whining.  Whining and spinning.  Really ALOT of spinning.  Like a mustang with a tiny invisible rider.  I suppose it wouldn't be considered pure whining in the lexical sense.  More of a fervent pleading mixed with almost incommunicable impatience; all wrapped into a high pitched moan matched by an unyielding stare intently trying to detect any possibility of her impassioned pleas being met.  Dakota could only be described as a 'funny looking' dog, and some might consider that to be an understatement.  I've described her to some as a dog that was perhaps assembled from the spare parts of other, more noble, animals.  Buggy eyes, big floppy ears, and more muscle mass than I'll ever have; her lineage is murky.  However, what she lacks in physical beauty, she more than makes up for in disposition.  She is a giant, black and white, whirlwind of happiness.  No one who has spent 5 minutes in Dakota's presence could possibly argue that her temperament contains even a hint of aggression, so much so that even the idea of scolding her with a "bad dog" seems harsh when confronted with her giant smile and furiously wagging tail, which is perpetually fueled simply by the slightest attention.  Some have called her 'simple', or that she has perhaps been 'touched in the head', to borrow a phrase from the distant past.  Be that as it may (and it may very well be), she is my best friend.  And I can't say no to my best friend, especially when it seems her giant heart might truly shatter if I were to ignore her for another moment. So I caved.  If I hadn't, or if she had been worn out from patrolling the backyard all day, we may have both missed out on one of the most illuminating events of our lives.

			<h2>a place to call our own... </h2>
		</header>
		<p>
		Bastion Park is a <i>remarkable</i> place.  Nestled quietly in a suburban area of an otherwise overly-urban part of town, the sprawling acreage is a vertible oasis in an otherwise urbane, decaying neighborhood.  Multiple large lakes, pavillions, baseball diamonds, playgrounds, and well kept trails constitute our late night locale.  From the earliest signs of Spring through the last days of Autumn, Dakota and I make the most of this otherwise under-utilized mecca.  Over the course of several years, we have enjoyed our late night paradise with next to no interruption from the outside world.  On extremely rare occassions, a stray park ranger or group of drunk teenagers have temporarily invaded our solace, but it has always been isolated and short lived.   Between the hours of midnight and 4am this place is ours.  This night didn't, at least on the surface, appear to be any different.  It was the middle of the week on a brutally hot and humid night.  Aside from the possible opossum and the dozens of duck, goose, and swan that ring the lakes nightly, we appear to once again have our run of the place.  Before Stella (our ancient Ford pickup) had come to a complete stop, Dakota was out of the flatbed and on her way to see what may have changed since yesterday.  The answer is always 'nothing', but trying to explain that to her has always proven fruitless.  I grab her leash (a largely unecessary but needed convention) and start down the hill towards the "World's Happiest Dog."  
	</p>

	<p>
		Our routine is generally the same.  Dakota bounds into the park, and I hurry to catch up to her.  She darts about furiously, smelling and marking damn near everything in site.  Even though she has unfettered access to a sizable yard at home, there is no subsitute for the amount of energy she is able to burn at Bastion.  She is an almost unnaturally energetic dog, and being able to sprint 50 yards just to scare some ducks is something that the backyard just can't provide.  I noticed it the day after our first visit to the park several years ago.  Whereas she had been quite happy but clearly 'pent up', the day after our first visit to Bastion; she had a more centered, content, and (importantly) <strong>worn out</strong> vibe that told me immediately that this needed to be a part of our daily lives.  And so it has become.  This night felt no different.  It was hot.  Very hot, especially for 3am.  The sky was empty, littered with stars and a large full moon, rising rapidly and annhilating any tiny pins of light that might be in the way.  We strolled down the well kept path.  The rain storm that had punctuated the hot summer afternoon had given the local flora ample ammunition to grow, and what was a clean cut pasture 24 hours ago now appeared to be an out of control nature preserve.  Shortly, we came upon the first of several of Bastion's lakes.  This one, although the smallest, had the distinct honor of having taught 'Kota how to swim on our first trip here.  We had been walking, the dog ecstatic with our new found digs and I, while keeping my head on a swivel (not yet knowing that this park was truly ours in the dead of night), heard a <strong><i>"SPLOOOOSH"</i></strong> behind me.  It only took a split second to realize that she, despite never having seen such a body of water before, had encountered a turtle or fish and promptly dove into the lake in hot pursuit.  All mass, no brains, she rapidly sank to the bottom of the man-made lake, which does not have the graduated shores of a natural pool.  I quickly fished her out, and she, being none the worse for wear, flung off the water and bounded off.  I can still she her curious little eyes, showing no small amount of panic, staring back at me from under the water's surface.  As it turns out, hers would not be the only eyes I would ever see from beyond the lake's surface.

		Aside from Dakota's impromtu swimming experiment, or the occasional bout with nocturnal wildlife, nothing of particular merit had ever occured in all the evenings that we spent in respite at Bastion Park.  She would bound and frolic and I would think, decompress, and get some needed exercise myself.  This night would prove to be different, in ways that I could never imagine and still to this day scarcely believe.  On the evening in question, we crossed had already crossed the foot bridge over the small lake (without any incident of dog playing fish) and set upon the first of several pavillions on our usual path.  While I sat on the rubberized picnic table, fiddling with my phone; Dakota made sure that every single duck sleeping on the shores of the lake had been thoroughly roused.  With ferocious quacking, the ducks (and what I can only assume was a crane), quickly paddled to the center of the water.  With no one left to play with, Dakota returned to me at the pavillion and we continued on our way to one of her favorite spots, the leaky water fountain.  
		</p>
		<p>
			The "Perfectly Leaky Water Fountain" marks the half way point in our normal journey.  Adorably, Dakota seems to rediscover it for the first time every night.  The fountain is one that everyone has some level of familiarity with, wrought iron with a kick-pedal that triggers a stream of surprisingly fresh, cool water.  This particular fountain had, over the course of decades, developed a useful leak.  After roughly 10 seconds, water begins to pool at it's base, creating a makeshift doggy-fountain from which Dakota eagerly slurps up her fill.  From there, after a quick spell of rolling around happily on a nearby patch of grass, we are on our way.  Normally we would follow the road that forms the western border of the park, but there is the less used option of taking a trail to the parks interior, where the largest of Bastion's lakes resides.  9 times out of 10 we would have continued away from the lake, but for some reason this night was different.  With nothing more than a brief, curious glance; Dakota and I turned onto the trail that would lead us to the heart of the park.

			The odds would favor, after hundreds of nights, that we would eventually encounter someone else in the park.  Perhaps another outlaw dog walker, or maybe a couple using the park as a place for a late night rendezvous. Despite my constant scrutiny of the horizon, as we walk as well as passing cars and even shadows in the distance, night after night, we have had the place all to ourselves.  Or so we thought.  As we meandered down the path, Dakota darting back and forth on sniff patrol, we rounded the corner and my eyes, always scanning the distance for possible interlopers, traced the shore line of the park's largest lake.  Under the brightly lit July sky, the lake glistened with an almost unnatural hue.  I had often mused that we were incredibly lucky to have such a pristine place to stretch our collective legs in solitutde every night, especially one that is surrounded by a one of the most rundown and decaying cities in the country.  The view of the mist slowly billowing across the lake as we rounded the bend reinforced that sentiment and then some.  It was almost as if we were staring into a painting, or perhaps were trapped in a virtual reality where the lighting isn't <i>quite</i> right.  Details seemed slightly sharper than they should be, colors slightly deeper.  The wind blew for the first time since we had arrived, and it traveled across the fields, down upon the water, and finally reached us.  The chilled air came across us like a cloud might block the sun.  Even Dakota had ceased her normal frenetics and seemed to be as close to reverie as I had ever seen her.  We stood silently, together on the path, letting the breeze bring momentary relief to the still, seemingly impermeable heat.  As my eyes continued from the shore on to the small fishing pier, I tried to remember a night quite at the park that was quite as vibrant, hell, downright psychedelic as this one.  Then I saw her.

		Hundreds, hell maybe thousands.  Thousands of nights and never once had this happend.  I can't even count how many times my mind had wandered into the fantasy of bumping into a beautiful girl, also walking her ugly dog in the dead of night.  However, despite these flights of fancy, it had simply never happend.  We had always been alone in our expeditions, until now.  Though the pier was 100 yards or so from where we stood on the path, I could make out her long hair, lifted occasionally by the breeze.  Silhouetted by the moonlight, she stood at the end of the pier, seemingly lost in the same exilient moment as I.  Stunned, I looked down to find that Dakota, normally oblivious to anything outside her locus of pounce-ability, had also noticed the pier's inhabitant.  She was off before my left hand could lunge for her collar.  There are fast dogs, and then there are <i>really</i> fast dogs.  Dakota falls into the category of the latter.  When she takes off on you, it becomes something similar to Boss Hog chasing the Dukes of Hazzard.  She simply has the better engine and the reckless abandon to use it.  Aside from hope and the rapid discharge of explicatives, theres little to be done.  Although not the first impression I had hoped to make, if any at all, I had no choice but to give chase down the path, hoping that something else might distract her before she made it all the way to the lake.

		As I briskly followed after 'Kota, my eyes darted between the pier and the last known location of the dog.  Much closer now, I could make out more than just the form of a girl in the distance.  She was young, probably in her early 20s.  Auburn hair fell across her shoulders in waves, contrasting the bright yellow of her sun dress.  She was pretty, beautiful in fact.  Her pale skin reflected moonlight in a way that I had not ever seen before.  Why on Earth is she in this park alone at night?  In a city like this one, it seemed like a quick way to end up with your (decidedly lovely) face on the side of a milk carton.  Her gaze turned from the sky to a small notebook she was carrying as she sat down at the end of the pier.   It seemed she had picked the right evening to visit, as it was certainly bright enough to read and write by moonlight.  Dakota was roughly 30 feet ahead of me, and though she had stopped at a firepit to investigate the remains of a picnic, it wouldn't be long before she reached the pier.  I tried to call her back, but as I did the breeze picked up and brought my voice back to me, along with the rustling of leaves and the nearing sound of water slapping against the shore of the lake.  Unless something changed dramatically in the next 30 seconds, our young interloping friend was about to get the surprise greeting of her life.

		Dakota has a way of meeting people that is generally regarded poorly.  Her pure enthusiasm for making new friends and greeting old ones, combined with her pure physicality, ends up overwhelming most people, myself included.  Although she's hard to stay mad at, her lack of restraint when it comes to bouncing around (and into) people had always been a problem.  Now as I saw her rounding the corner the final bend to the pier, I had no chioce but to break into a full on sprint, knowing that it was already way too late.  She took the handful of stairs in one bound, barely slowing at all.  The girl, somehow, remained entirely oblivious to her approach.  She sat, eyes fixed to her notebook, her legs over the piers edge, bare feet skimming the waters surface.  Again the breeze picked up, this time nearly a gust, as I finally reached the pier.  I yelled out, almost reflexively, to blunt the surprise at the last moment, but it was too late.  Dakota, within feet of this gorgeous and entirely unaware young girl, without so much as pumping the brakes.. ran straight into her.  I closed my eyes at the last second, and all I heard was <strong><i>SPLOOOOOOOOSSSSHHHH.</i></strong>

		I rarely, if ever, actually stood on the pier myself.  For some reason it held no appeal and our normal course around the park simply avoided it.  Now, for seemingly the first time, I stood upon it in disbelief.  As I opened one eye, then the other, I was stunned to see the young woman, sitting entirely unmoved at the edge of the pier.  The sploosh I heard was Dakota!  I ran to the length of the pier in a heartbeat, stopping only for the briefest millisecond before jumping headlong into the water, ungracefully entering the tepid pool a few feet from where Dakota was pathetically trying to stay afloat.  As I somewhat frantically tried to direct the dog by the collar towards the shore, my eyes returned to the pier, where I fully expected to see a panicked stranger.  She remained, almost absurdly, unmoved.  Her eyes were no longer on her notebook, but lightly scanning the opposite shore of the lake.  It seemed, no it WAS, literally impossible for her to not notice the pathetic 'boy and his dog' directly in front of her, but somehow she seemed entirely unaware of the struggle going on beneath her feet.  I yelled out, but it seemed she was equally incapable of hearing the strife below as she was blind to it.  Momentarily stunned, I gathered myself and my simple minded friend and began slowly dragging her into shore; momentarily reflecting on the possibility that she was the world's ugliest fish.  
		</p>
		<p>
		As we emerged on the shore, my mind reeled with the odd events of the last five minutes.  Dakota, seemingly none the worse for wear, after a few quick shakes to shed the lake water, looked up at me with her trademark simple grin.  How is it possible that she avoided the girl on the pier?  Had she jumped at the last second?  Even if she had, how could it possibly be that the ensuing struggle went entirely unnoticed?  Posterity be damed, and soaking wet, I started up the slight embankment towards the pier to find out.  I don't know what I expected, perhaps that she had fled or would be waiting to see us emerge safely; maybe having even called the fuzz.  What happend next, I could not have anticipated.  As we approached the pier and ascended the stairs, the young woman set down her notebook and stood up, still facing the lake.  With seemingly practiced grace, her sundress fell to her feet, and she stood nude at the end of pier, briefly, before diving gracefully into the water.  In disbelief, we walked to the end of the pier, where her small pile of a dress and notebook remained.  As I looked down, what I had believed was a notebook was instead something entirely different.  It most closely resembled a small television, but flat.  Most oddly it was small, maybe the size of a book, but was illuminated as if by the moonlight.. but from within.  Upon its 'screen', there was what appeared to be a facsimile of a newspaper article.  It was dated, impossibly, as being July 17th, 2015 - and the article detailed the work of a local musician's new album and his inspiration for the title track: a man that had drowned in the late 1970's in a local park, known for its lakes, trying to save his dog from drowning.
