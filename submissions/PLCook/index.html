					<p>My all time favorite place to go mountain biking is Castlewood State Park, in Ballwin, MO, a suburb of St. Louis. There are several different trails of varying difficulty winding throughout the park. While there are no true mountains, the hills surrounding the Meramec River offer a challenging ride for experienced riders, while the river valley itself allows an easier, yet enjoyable, ride for beginnners and experienced riders alike. Most trails are single track, and the terrain varies from hard pack dirt to tree root studded rocks. The view from the tops of the bluff overlooking the river valley afford quite a view to the south. One can see the more developed parts of West County to the east, while south and westward are a panorama of hills and forest with the river cutting a path through the valley below. Sadly, due to accidents, most access to the trails along the tops of the bluffs has been restricted for mountain bikes. Technically, unless otherwise noted, bikes have the right of way on these trails. However, most hikers and walkers are unaware of these rules. So, a biker must be cautious at all times, especially during nice weekends.</p>

					<p>While I first began my mountain biking career in Castlewood, which was conveniently located from my parents house, I have since moved. Getting to the park by car from my current house has become an inconvenience, at least. So, it has become our tradition to meet and park at the Al Foster Trailhead, in Glencoe, MO. This is a county park, and therefor pedestrians are given the right of way, so care must be taken to avoid them. The trail itself is a mostly gravel out and back double track plus pathway. The terrain is super flat and mostly straight all the way to Sherman Beach. Now, once you reach Sherman Beach, you get back onto the hard pack single track, which, if followed correctly, will lead you to the lower paths of Castlewood. Two rides in one! This is a perfect trail for beginners to ride, or a nice little warm up for riders who are headed to the more challenging trails of Castlewood. Parking is easier, except on Sundays in the summer when the narrow gauge train is running. GORC has also recently added a newer, single track trail that branches off from the Al Foster, which will take experienced riders to the tops of the bluffs near Glencoe. Once to the top, there is a nice panoramic view of the former Times Beach site, which is now a state park across the river. This trail is a short out and back, but requires some intermediate climbing and more difficult terrain.</p>

					<p>Much closer to home these days is the Lost Valley Trail along Hwy 94 in St. Charles County, MO. This trail offers a several mile loop with no amenities. Lost Valley is certainly not for beginners, and intermediate riders should be a little more experienced before taking a swing at it. The terrain offers something for everyone. It ranges from flat gravel double track to steep, rocky ascents and descents on what can barely be considered a marked trail, with everything, including old fire roads, in between. The main trail is about an 8 mile loop, while there are several offshoot trails that offer other riding experiences. Recently, this has become a popular trail for cross country runners, so keep any eye out for them. Bring lots of mosquito repellant!</p>

					</figure>
					<p>The Chubb Trail runs roughly along the opposite bank of the Meramec River from Castlewood State Park. It is an out and back trail accessible from Hwy 44 between Valley Park and Eureka. This trail is not for beginners, and again should only be attempted by more experienced and advanced riders. The terrain is mostly rocky single track, although this becomes more hard pack dirt as you descend into the river valley. Some people who ride in groups are known to park a car at each end of the trail and ride only the downhill, then drive back to the start. I can't blame them. The uphill ride is miserable, especially to fat guys like me.</p>

					<section>
						<h4>Katy Trail</h4>
						<p>The Katy Trail is a long, wide gravel trail that runs between Machens, MO and Clinton, MO. It is an easy ride with almost no climbs or descents. There are many trailheads to get on and off the trail. There are also quite a few amenities, as small businesses cater to trail users on weekends and during the summer. The surface is crushed limestone. This can cause some tire wear to softer tires. The trails main use to more experienced mountain bikers is as a way to get some good training miles in, especially when other trails become too muddy to ride without damage.</p>

						<h4>Bangert Island</h4>
						<p>Bangert Island is a small island located near the Ameristar Casino. It is currently only accessible via the Katy Trail, though there are plans to change that by putting in parking. The trails are very short, single track hard pack. There aren't any real climbs or descents to speak of. Riding there is a reminder of what Castlewood State Park was before it became so popular, as the trails are unimproved. Trails can be ridden by pretty much any experience level without too much trouble.</p>

						<h4>Cuivre River State Park</h4>
						<p>Cuivre River State Park offers a few trails to ride on in the Lincoln County area. The trails are mostly single track and their surface alternates between hard pack and rocky. None of trails could be considered improved, however they also wouldn't be considered too terribly difficult. The biggest problem is sharing the trails with equestrians. Some are accomodating, but many do not like bikers. Also, there is horse droppings everywhere, which is pretty disgusting. I'd only ride here again if there were just no where else at all to ride.</p>

					<h2 class="summary">Summary</h2>
					<p>Living in the St. Louis area, we are lucky to have access to some pretty nice trails to ride on. It may not be downhilling in Colorado, or trail blazing in Utah, but they're enough to keep us riding between vacations.</p>
