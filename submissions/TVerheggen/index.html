          <h2>Field School &amp; Cahokia Mounds</h2>
          <p>I got my start in prehistoric archaeology digging a site near Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville.  It was a pre-Cahokian and my job (once in the lab) was to look for evidence of maize.  We were trying to track down the entrance of corn into local society.  Cahokia Mounds is about 20 minutes east of St. Louis, MO.<a href="http://www.cahokiamounds.org">Visit Cahokia!</a></p>

          <h2>Olympic Peninsula, WA</h2> 
          <p>  I worked along-side the Lower Elwha K'lallam Tribe in recovery of an amazing site on the Puget Sound, Olympic Peninsula, WA. <a href="http://www.elwha.org">Read about the Tse-Whit-Zen site &amp; the tribe.</a></p>

                <figcaption>The year of the excavation was also the first year (in many) that this tribe repeated it's custom of taking a canoe journey to Canada.  And this is how I know I am a wimp.</figcaption>

          <h2>Outer Banks, NC</h2> 
          <p>  I got to watch dolphins swim and historic ships sail by while working near the Outer Banks, NC.  The surf isn't all that great in the Outer Banks, and working on a beach is actually pretty awful.  As always, the crew (family) keeps it awesome.</p>

          <h2>Buffalo, WY</h2> 
          <p>I hiked all day on ranch lands near the foothills of the Little Big Horn Mtns in Wyoming.  Pretty much awesome.  This is by far my favorite country and the sky really is BIG!</p>

          <h3>The Mayan Route</h3> 
          <p>I took some time off to travel the Mayan Route &amp; see ruins in Central America.  After finishing language school in Costa Rica we chicken-bussed it up to the Yucatan.  Can you guess what music was playing as we flew like crazy people down the mountainside leaving Gautemala?  Madonna &amp; Bon Jovi.  Hang onto your chickens everybody!  We're livin on a prayer</p>
