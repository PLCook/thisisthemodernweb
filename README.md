###A starter project for those looking to learn HTML5, CSS3 and responsive design.

####Quick access to each section:
* [Setup](tree/gh-pages/setup)
* [This is HTML5](tree/gh-pages/thisishtml5)
* [This is CSS3](tree/gh-pages/thisiscss3)
* [This is responsiveness](tree/gh-pages/thisisresponsiveness)
