# This is HTML5
(In David Malan voice...)

A starter project for those looking to learn html5

###Your mission, should you choose to accept it:

1. Fork this repo ([remember how?](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)), and clone it to your local machine. (If you haven't set up your GitHub account and/or haven't learned the basics of GitHub yet, start with the [git-it tutorial over at nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io)).
2. Create a new branch with the name "add-&lt;username&gt;" (where &lt;username&gt; is your GitHub username, e.g. "add-chrisbay") and switch to your new branch on your local machine. (Not sure what this means? Time to go back and review or actually do [that nodeschool.io tutorial](http://nodeschool.io).)
3. Create a new directory: `submissions/<username>`. 
4. Create a new `index.html` file within your new directory, and stub it out with these basic elements: the HTML5 doctype, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, and `<body>`, with appropriate content.
5. Add five `<meta>` tags to the `<head>`, one to specify the `charset` as UTF-8, and four with `name`/`content` attribute pairs, with `name` equal to each of `"description"`, `"keywords"`, `"author"` and `"viewport"`. (To brush up on these `<meta>` tags, head over to [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp) and look at the source for [my page in the project](http://chrisbay.github.io/thisishtml5/submissions/chrisbay/).)
6. Build a page that...
	* TODO
7. Don't break these rules:
	* No CSS.
	* Really, no CSS!
	* Your page must validate as HTML5 using the [w3c Validator](http://validator.w3.org). Among other things, this means you may not use things such as `<font>` tags or the `background` attribute on your `<body>`. (Don't worry, we'll make our page look pretty later.)
	* Be original, and create your page without looking at the source for other pages in the project (other than the one linked above).
8. Make a few commits and pushes as you go. Once you've pushed your first set of pages, you should be able to view your page live at [http://&lt;username&gt;.github.io/thisishtml5/submissions/&lt;username&gt;/]
8. When you're done, commit and push your changes to your fork (add some nice comments), and [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) so your changes can be merged into the main repo.
9. Wait for your changes to be pulled, and then look for your page on [the project page](http://chrisbay.github.io/thisishtml5/)!
