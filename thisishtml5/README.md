#This is HTML5

This is the first of three exercises, which build off of each other. You'll get comfortable with semantic markup, some elements introduced by HTML5, and separating content from design and layout.

###Prerequisites
* You've set up your environment and the project as outlined in the [setup guide](../tree/gh-pages/setup)
* Familiarity with the basics of HTML
* Understanding of 

###Your mission, should you choose to accept it:

1. Stub out `submissions/<username>/index.html` it out with these basic elements: the HTML5 doctype, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, and `<body>`, with appropriate content.
2. Add five `<meta>` tags to the `<head>`, one to specify the `charset` as UTF-8, and four with `name`/`content` attribute pairs, with `name` equal to each of `"description"`, `"keywords"`, `"author"` and `"viewport"`. (To brush up on these `<meta>` tags, head over to [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp) and look at the source for [my page in the project](http://chrisbay.github.io/thisishtml5/submissions/chrisbay/).) You don't need to fully understand what each of these does; that will become clear as we go along.
3. Build a page that...
	* Tells a story. This can be personal, or not. Funny, serious or neither. You can do whatever you like, but generally, it should be something in the range of 3-10 paragraphs or sections. Here are some ideas:
		- Tell your backstory (a la [about.me](https://about.me/backstory))
		- Tell the story of a trip that you took
		- Talk about some hobby or passion of yours
	* Correctly uses each of the following 
4. Don't break these rules:
	* No CSS.
	* Really, no CSS!
	* Each HTML5 element should have semantic meaning. If you add a `<div>` or `<span>` you should be ready to justify your decision.
	* Your page must validate as HTML5 using the [w3c Validator](http://validator.w3.org). Among other things, this means you may not use things such as `<font>` or `<b>` tags, or the `background` attribute on your `<body>`. (Don't worry, we'll make our page look pretty later.)
	* Be original, and create your page without looking at the source for other pages in the project (other than the one linked above).
5. When you're done, commit and push all changes to your fork (add some nice comments), and [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) so your changes can be merged into the main repo.
6. Wait for your changes to be pulled, and then look for your page on [the project page](http://chrisbay.github.io/thisishtml5/)!
7. Well done. Time to [dive into some CSS]()!
